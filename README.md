ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project aims to analyse the sales data of a pizza business to derive actionable insights and visualise key metrics. Using SQL queries and Power BI, it provides a dashboard for understanding sales performance, customer behaviour, and product trends.

Load and prepare raw sales data into a structured format using SQL.
Perform data modelling and transformation inside Power BI.
Create interactive visualisations and dashboards to answer business-questions such as:
Which pizza types, sizes or toppings generate the highest revenue?
What are the peak sales periods (by day, week, month)?
Who are the top customers or customer segments?
What are the trends in sales over time?
Are there underperforming items or opportunities for upsell/cross-sell?

Microsoft Power BI (.pbix): Used for data modelling, creating visuals and building the dashboard.
Data source: Sales transactional data from the pizza business (orders, customers, products etc).
